❓ Frequently Asked Questions
1. How do I reset my password?
Currently, Pluto does not support password reset. If you're locked out, please contact us with your registered email.

2. Is my data safe?
Yes. We do not sell or share your data. All data stays within Pluto and is only used for core app functionality. View our full Privacy Policy.

3. Why can’t I link my bank account?
Pluto is a manual tracker by design — there are no bank connections. You control what goes in and out.

4. Can I export my data?
Exporting is not currently supported, but we're considering it. Let us know if this is something you'd like.

5. How do I delete my account?
You can delete your account through the Settings screen in the app. This will delete all your data.
